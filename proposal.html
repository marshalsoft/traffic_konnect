            <p><span class="token">[Client.FirstName]</span>,</p>
            <p>On behalf of the entire team here at <span class="token">[Sender.Company]</span> , I want to thank you
                for the opportunity to earn your business as your provider of web design services. There are thousands

                opportunity to earn your business. I cannot understate how much we appreciate being able to put this
                proposal in front of you today. </p>
            <p>At <span class="token">[Sender.Company]</span> we believe in standing out. We stand out as a web design
                company by insisting on pushing the boundaries of website performance, and by delivering work of the

                satisfied. We’re committed to helping your brand stand out in a crowded market, against a sea of hungry
                competitors. </p>
            <p>I’ve included a lot of detail in this proposal, because I want to make it abundantly clear that
                <strong><span class="token">[Sender.Company]</span> is the best web design company in business
                    today</strong>.You’ll find details regarding the functionality of your future website, our web
                design process, testimonials from past<span class="token">[Sender.Company]</span>clients, and detailed
                project pricing.</p>
            <p>To make things simple for you, this proposal doubles as an executable contract. We’ve included all
                necessary terms of agreement at the end, and your electronic signature turns it into a binding project,
                allowing us to move forward with your web design project immediately.</p>

                    <h3>Initial Planning</h3>
                    <p>The first order of business is to sit down with your team and create a detailed set of design and
                        technical specifications. These specifications serve as a roadmap for the rest of the web design
                        process. </p>

                    <h3>Wireframing</h3>
                    <p>Wireframes are your first chance to visualize your website. While they’re not nearly as detailed
                        as the final site will be, they give us a visual representation of the site’s overall layout.

                            alt="Icon"></p>
                    <h3>Mockups</h3>
                    <p>Once all site mockups are completed and approved, we’ll proceed with site mockups. These add
                        color and a bit more detail to the initial wireframes, giving us a stronger visual
                        representation of the final product. </p>

                            alt="Icon"></p>
                    <h3>Copy &amp; Graphics</h3>
                    <p>Once we’ve agreed on a final design based on the mockups, our team will proceed with development,
                        kicking off two phases in unison. The first involves creating your site’s copy and graphics. Our
                        team will get to work performing SEO and competitive research and come up with the copy and
                        images that will flesh out your final site. </p>

                    <h3>Development</h3>
                    <p>At the same time, we’ll kick off the technical side of the web design process. This will include
                        deploying your CMS, creating your custom theme and page designs, and setting up your website’s
                        analytics. </p>

                    <h3>Testing</h3>
                    <p>Once our writers, designers, and developers have finished their work, our Quality Assurance team
                        will get to work testing your site’s performance and reliability. We’ll use various tools to
                        benchmark your site for loading, responsiveness, and speed, while also ensuring that it works
                        reliably on all web browsers and mobile devices. </p>

                    alt="Icon"></p>
            <h3>Deployment &amp; Optimization</h3>
            <p>Once we’re sure that your site is ready to be released to the public, we’ll deploy it on your public
                domain. Then, we’ll shift into a monthly support process that will continue for 12 months. During that
                period, we’ll create monthly backups of your site, update scripts and plugins to maintain security and
                reliability, and perform layout and content updates at your request. </p>
